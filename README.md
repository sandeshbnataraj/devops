# 🚀 DevOps

Welcome to my **DevOps** project — a structured and evolving repository of notes, scripts, and automation tools as I build hands-on expertise across the DevOps ecosystem.

This repo starts with Linux fundamentals and scripting, and will grow to include containerization, CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as code, monitoring, and more.
